# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please DO NOT open an issue or publicly disclose the vulnerability.

Instead, disclose the vulnerability using any of the following methods:

- Contact our team privately via [email](mailto:dingjoys@metopia.xyz).

- Submit a report through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting system](https://github.com/Metopian/metopia-kwil/security/advisories/new).

Your report will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your report within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

## Disclosure Policy

In the event that we learn of a critical security vulnerability, we reserve the right to silently fix it without immediately disclosing the existence of the vulnerability.

In such a scenario, we will:

1. Silently fix the vulnerability in a new release.

2. Notify all users of the affected versions that they should upgrade to the new release.

3. After a reasonable period of time, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, along with credit to the reporter (with their permission).

This policy is based on the Geth team's [silent patch policy](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/geth-developer/disclosures).
